# Cosmic-Reach-Localization
Language translations and localization utilities for the game Cosmic Reach. This project is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/FinalForEach/Cosmic-Reach-Localization/blob/master/LICENSE).
The font is mostly community contributed, with some sprites being loosely based off of [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) which is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

## IMPORTANT
When creating a pull request MAKE SURE THAT:
1) Your name is added to CREDITS.txt
2) **Do NOT** use AI for translations, unless you are looking up **single words** in dictionaries / translation websites.
3) You modify AS FEW FILES AS POSSIBLE! For example, don't modify german to fix typos if your pull request is supposed to be adding spanish translations. Make TWO separate pull requests instead.
4) (OPTIONAL) If adding a new language, post the entire alphabet if possible. This will make it easier to add relevant font glyphs for the language.
